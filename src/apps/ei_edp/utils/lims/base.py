"""LIMS adapter interface.

COPO's EDP flow needs to talk to a Laboratory Information Management System
(LIMS) at a handful of well-defined points: when a profile is saved or deleted,
when a manifest is generated or ingested, and when the sample-type dropdown is
built. Historically all of these called Sapio (via `sapiopylib`) directly from
`edp_utils.py` and `EDPSchemasHandler.py`.

`LIMSAdapter` is the seam that decouples that. Each supported LIMS ships a
concrete subclass; the active one is chosen at runtime from the
`LIMS_ADAPTER` setting (see `get_lims_adapter`). The rest of COPO only ever
sees this interface.

Design rules that keep the interface LIMS-neutral:

- Inputs and outputs speak COPO's language, never the LIMS's. Methods take the
  COPO `profile` dict and single-cell `schemas`, and return records keyed by
  COPO `term_name`. All translation to LIMS field names (e.g. Sapio's
  `sapio_name` schema column, "Object:Field") lives *inside* the adapter.
- Status-returning methods use the same `{"status": ..., "message": ...}`
  convention as the rest of the codebase, so they drop straight into the
  existing profile-hook call sites.
- Physical-lab concepts that not every LIMS shares (plates, wells, containers)
  are never exposed here. `sync_project` is intent-level ("make the LIMS
  reflect this profile") so a Sapio adapter can do 96-well packing internally
  while another LIMS ignores the concept entirely.
