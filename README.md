## Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) Project

The Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) project is an open-source web-based platform that enables scientists to describe their research objects (e.g. raw or processed data, assemblies, reads, samples and images) using community-sanctioned metadata sets and vocabularies.

As a metadata broker, COPO encourages scientists to submit metadata that complies with the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles. These research objects are then shared with the wider scientific community via public repositories. The COPO project is based at the Earlham Institute in Norwich, England, United Kingdom.

This repository builds on the work of the [COPO](https://github.com/collaborative-open-plant-omics/COPO) GitHub repository (now archived), which laid the foundation for the current implementation.
